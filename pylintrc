# Reasons disabled:
# locally-disabled - it spams too much
# duplicate-code - unavoidable
# cyclic-import - doesn't test if both import on load
# unused-argument - generic callbacks and setup methods create a lot of warnings
# global-statement - used for the on-demand requirement installation
# redefined-variable-type - this is Python, we're duck typing!
# too-many-* - are not enforced for the sake of readability
# too-few-* - same as too-many-*
# abstract-method - with intro of async there are always methods missing
